# Easymeal

## Objective
EasyMeal was created as Final Project for the subject Taller de Investigaci√≥n II, where we as team investigated about the waste of food around the world. As an attempt to reduce the waste of food, and save some money in our families pocket, we developed this app, were you con control your cupboard. 
We also created a recipe repository inside the app where you find your recipes, and at the same time add them to an itinerary, and have a little more control of your meals.
Finally we introduced an option to export a kind of shopping list, with the amount of products that you need for your meals of the week, or in the other hand make the shopping list in the phone, saving as you can see paper.

Another section that was developed was EasyMealBussines, created for nutritionists, this section isn't free, here you con buy a license with limited amount of customer, and give them prescriptions or receipts to make their life a little bit more healthier.
